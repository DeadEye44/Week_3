# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Task

This week's Challenge required us to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
